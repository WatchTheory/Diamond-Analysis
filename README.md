## Summary 
## Key Visualization 

## Visulization 1:
This is a histogram of the sum of carat of the diamond. As you can see from the graph the more `ideal` diamonds that cost far more than have a higher sum compared to the `Fair` the lowest of the carets. That is below $2K.

## Visulization 2:
This bar graph measure the `depth` to the `table`. `Table` is refer to the top of the diamond where light comes in and `depth` refers to the vertical cut at the bottom, simply put, table refers to how diamond at the bottom was cut. 

Here is a scatterplot showing out of the 5 groups, `Fair` covers a major portion of the dept while `Good` and `Very Good` have smaller portion.
